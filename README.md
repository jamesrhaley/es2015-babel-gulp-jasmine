# es2015-babel-gulp-jasmine

> Boilerplate build system that is able to compile code from ES6 to ES5 including module support and tests via jasmine.  Please use if it helps.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Build

Before you build you should have global installation of `gulp` package.

```
gulp
```

## Test

You should have global installation of `jasmine` package. At this time tests are run by `npm test` rather than gulp due to my own lack of knowledge. Please visit https://github.com/piecioshka/test-jasmine-babel for more info

```
npm test
```

## Extra

If you want an executable to do the heavy lifting of updating this boiler plate you can find it here https://github.com/jamesrhaley/boilJS.  It is writen in python.
